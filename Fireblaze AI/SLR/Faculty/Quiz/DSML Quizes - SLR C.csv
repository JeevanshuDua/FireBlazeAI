The Durbin-Watson statistic is used to test for,Multicollinearity,Autocorrelation,Heteroskedasticity,All of the above are correct,B
,,,,,
Why should we assume that relationships between variables are linear?,Because linear relationships are the simplest non-trivial relationships that can be imagined.,"Because the ""true"" relationships between our variables are often at least approximately linear over the range of values","Even if they're not, we can often transform the variables in such a way as to linearize the relationships.",All of these,D
